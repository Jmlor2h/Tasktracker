# TASK TRACKER 2022

##### This app can read, write, update, and delete tasks from a todo list.



# Difficulties

##### Difficulties I had with this project were trying to use Node's FS as well as attempting to use it with express methods (get, put, post, etc). I attempted to try it that way when we first got the project and just could not figure out how to manipulate the json file with any of these methods. So I opted for a different method with the same results, I was able to learn and use express, with mongoose/mongodb to create this task tracker. It was a great learning experience being able to utilize a real database and express methods to create this project. It was also my first time using a view engine template (EJS), which is very interesting to learn and use, I did come upon trouble attempting to link the DB but with a little google searches I was able to fix it. I am not proficient in any of these yet but hopefully with more studying and hands on practice I can be.
